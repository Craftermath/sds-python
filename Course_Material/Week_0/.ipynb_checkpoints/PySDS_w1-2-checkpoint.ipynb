    "# Learning Python: Iterations and control statements\n",

    "# Section 1. For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time we ended on collections. Often times we want to do something with every element in a collection. To do this we __iterate__ over a collection. To iterate means to start at the beginning of a collection, do something with the first value, then continue until we run out of values. Even though a dictionary is not ordered, it is still iterable, we just don't know the order in which we will iterate. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine iterating over a list and then transforming the values in that list. Imagine you have a list of words and you want to find out the average word length ( $\\bar{x}$, the __arithmetic mean__). You would first sum ( $\\sum$ ) all the words $w$ and then divide this sum by the number of words $n$. In formulae we would say you sum all the elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, that big E ($\\sum$) means add all the things afterwards in the specified range. The range is specified on the top (in this case $n$ or the number of words). The i = 1 means that we iterate one word after another, rather than skipping a word or taking every third (in which case it would show $i=3$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can translate this into computer code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~ python\n",
    "words = [\"apple\",\"banana\",\"chocolate\",\"dumpling\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "word_length_sum = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in words:\n",
    "    word_length_sum += i.length() # notice we use += here. \n",
    "    \n",
    "n = len(words) \n",
    "\n",
    "average_length = word_length_sum / n\n",
    "~~~ \n",
    "\n",
    "Above, the ```for i in words:``` is what defines the loop. It's pretty similar to English. ```i``` is our iterator. We could have named it anything, but traditionally when you don't care what your iterator is called, we use ```i``` for the first loop, ```j``` for an inner loop and ```k``` for a third inner loop. More than three inner loops and you really should rethink your program design. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can notice that ```i``` and ```words``` are variables because they are not given special colors. These colors help us understand which words are system words and which words are user-defined.  This is called __syntax highlighting__. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also use a shortcut above. Recall that in the past we have seen \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~ python \n",
    "result = x + y\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we wanted to add something to an existing variable, like when we add some numbers to a ```total```, we can do this: \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~ python\n",
    "total += y \n",
    "~~~ \n",
    "\n",
    "This is sometimes called __syntactic sugar__ as it is just a way to simplify code. In some languages, there's additional idiom of saying ```x++``` for ```x += 1```. This is where C++ gets its name. Python doesn't have this feature. It's just X += 1 for us. However, later we will see some very clever syntactic sugar in python...all in due course. \n",

Local variables are created and destroyed within their local context. You can watch this behavior with a code snippet. "
