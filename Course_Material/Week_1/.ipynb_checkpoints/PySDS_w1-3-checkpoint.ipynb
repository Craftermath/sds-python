    "Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome or iOS, all computers have an __operating system__.

This means they will have an input device (typically a keyboard but could be any sensor), a proccessor that does calculations, memory (typically fast memory such as RAM and slow memory such as a Hard Drive for more long term storage) and an output device (often, but not necessarily a screen). Other archtectures based on state machines and quantum computing exist but are often experimental and not quite relevant at the moment. \n",

Macintosh used to have its own operating system kernel, but has switched roughly 15 years ago to Unix for Mac OS X. There are many differences under the hood between Mac and Linux but for this lecture, we will focus on the many similarities related to file storage. These operating systems store files on a hard drive which can be accessed using the __file path__. \n"
