Regardless, Python is object oriented (as is Java, C++, swift, Objective-C, and Ruby, for example). Starting next week we will be using a lot of external packages in python. These packages will require you to be familiar with a host of different tools. These tools are normally objects. So learning how an object works, what you can do with it and how you might want to creat your own to help with your code is a very good idea. \n",

    "Remember before we said that there was a difference between functions and methods, but it wasn't that important. Now it gets a little more important. A __method__ is a function that is called by an object and operates on that object. This means that the method has a notion of a __self__. Self refers to the object that we created. So when we call:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Basic object example \n",
    "Imagine we have an object class called ```DoubleNumber```,  that stores two numbers. We then have two methods, ```getNumberA()``` and ```getNumberB()```. These objects will know that numbers A and B were already stored in the ```DoubleNumber``` object. In fact, we could make it so that the object can't be created without declaring what will be number A and what will be number B. \n",

    "See in the code above that the class is called DoubleNumber. When you call it by invoking ```dn = DoubleNumber()``` you now have an object called ```dn``` which is a ```DoubleNumber``` object. It comes ready-made with a numberA with a value of 0 and a numberB with a value of 42. You can discover these values by calling the ```get``` methods. Unfortunately, we can't use a method to change these values because we haven't created one! Below in the working code is a more elaborate class that you can use.  It will have get, set and another method for you to use. \n",

    "Part of the reason for showing a class is that it helps us understand the basis of objects, as each object is necessarily an __instantiation__ of some _class_ of object. So next week we will be exploring data wrangling and this will involve the use of more complex data structures thann we have seen up to this point. These structures are all their own kinds of objects with their own features. When you see: \n",

By calling ```df = pd.DataFrame()``` you are creating an __instance__ of the DataFrame class called df. As a class it has certain methods available to it. You can discover these methods with the ```dir(<instance>)``` command, which will list the methods available to that object. Try it with the list class below:  "
