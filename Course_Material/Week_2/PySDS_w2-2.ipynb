    "Basic file manipulation\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "File manipulation consists of creating file openers and then working with those openers. The openers take two arguments. The first is the path to the file. If there is no path given beyond the file name, it will assume that the file is in the same directory as the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "    fileopener = open(\"path\",\"r/w/a\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The second argument is either 'r', 'w' or 'a'. These respectively refer to read, write and append. Once you have a file opener you can either read the file or write the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading from a file**\n",
    "\n",
    "When reading a file, you can either read the entire contents with the read() command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    entire_file = fileopener.read()\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can also read line by line using an iterator. \n",
    "\n",
    "    for line in fileopener:\n",
    "        print(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember! When you do this, each line will be returned. These lines typically have a new line character at the end of the line. So when you print it, you will print a space in between these lines. The way to get rid of that character is to \"strip\" it from the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for line in fileopener:\n",
    "        print(line.strip())\n",
    "\n",
    "This will always start from the cursor. So if you have already read the file, you will either have to re-open it or set the cursor back to the original position. \n",
    "\n",
    "    fileopener.read()\n",
    "    fileopener.seek(0)\n",
    "    for line in fileopener:\n",
    "         print(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done you should close the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    fileopener.close()\n",
    "    \n",
    "** Writing to a File **\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing to a file involves again creating an opener. The command to write to a file is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    fileopener.write(STRING)\n",
    "     \n",
    "When you are done writing to the file it is also a good idea to close the file. Again, it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "This closing is less important for reading than it is for writing. Why? Because writing to the file doesn't always ensure that the physical harddrive is written. By closing the file, it will 'flush' the contents of the file to the hard disk. If in the case you think it's important to periodically flush the data to the hard disk this is possible, too:\n",
    "\n",
    "    fileopener.flush()\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING! Creating a writable file open actually creates a pointer to a file on the computer using the name of the file. This is especially important to understand because you can run the risk of destroying another file with the same name. This is what is called \"clobbering\". When you work in a word processor and try to save a file with the same name the computer will ask you 'file name already exists. are you sure?' or something to that effect. Python will not give such a warning. So please be careful with the names of your file openers.\n",

In python, this is called \"pickling\", as in the way one preserves things by putting them in jars with spices. In the simples instance, you merely want to call the \"dump\" or \"load\" methods. However, with Python 3, this works slightly differently than before. Now instead of writing the text as you read it, you have to write it as a stream of bytes. Go to a text editor and open a .jpeg or a .mp3 and you will see what a bytestring looks like. They are pretty unintelligible to humans but they work just fine for the computer. It is often a good idea to pickle some work if you are on a server and concerned what would happen if the program failed. \n",

Obviously, we could have just split on the tab character in this particular instance, but it's the logic of specifying regexs that's important, such as saying \"all digits\" or \"one or more digits plus a comma.\" In the parentheses for the regular expression we can either ask for 0,1,n or a predetermined number of characters. The characters can be in a range, such as 0-9 or a-z. But we can also use escape codes for the characters. See below for examples of regexs with text.  \n",
