    "\n",
    "JavaScript Object Notation [JSON] is one of the most popular forms for data transport. This is partially because it is easy in javascript to export data to this format. It is also partialy because it is very lightweight. By using only brackets, quotes and braces, you can structure most of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript looks very similar to python lists and dictionaries. In fact, I'm at a loss to think of a difference off hand. That being said, it is not advised to build your own json parser when python has one built in. \n",
    "\n",
    "As json is just lists and dicts it stands to reason that it could be human readable. If you will notice from looking at json on the web, it does not usually include whitespace. Yet, programs can often 'pretty print' the whitespace or better, turn the json automatically into a hierarchical structure to browse. On different browsers, try going to:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "https://www.reddit.com/.json \n",
    "~~~\n",
    "All of reddit's pages can be formatted as json. This makes them available to third party app providers. That being said, only some pages are accessible. Without proper authentication, you cannot view a user's private account details. But otherwise, by placing .json at the end of a reddit page and before the arguments, you can access it for later analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can load json data with: \n",
    "~~~\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "datastructure = json.loads(<The_Data>)\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can just query it as a series of nested lists and dictionaries. You can also print this data in a nice readable format (called pretty printing) in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "json.dumps(THE_DATA, indent=4) \n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways to pretty print. Let's look at json from Reddit pretty printed. Open a browser window and head to:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com \n",
    "\n",
    "In there type: \n",
    "\n",
    "http://reddit.com/r/aww.json \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how you can collapse and expand the json file. We will use this to navigate through the file then download it for processing. \n",
    "Json needs to be imported otherwise python will not recognize the commands. In python 2.* json was not fully implemented and people often had to go to the django package for a robust json parser. In python 3 we typically use the base package (```import json```). "

Obviously, we could have just split on the tab character in this particular instance, but it's the logic of specifying regexs that's important, such as saying \"all digits\" or \"one or more digits plus a comma.\" In the parentheses for the regular expression we can either ask for 0,1,n or a predetermined number of characters. The characters can be in a range, such as 0-9 or a-z. But we can also use escape codes for the characters. See below for examples of regexs with text.  \n",
