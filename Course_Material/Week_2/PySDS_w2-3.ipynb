    "# Section 1. Using sql databases\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a way to store data in relational tables. This is to say tables that follow the row / column format. Each 'database' can store multiple tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a movement in recent years away from relational databases towards newer forms of data stores, such as GraphDB and MongoDB, as part of the 'noSQL' paradigm. First, that's silly. Seccond, it's a little presumptuous to assume that other data stores can do the trick better. \n",
    "- MongoDB is a store for json-like objects. It's fast, simple and not so powerful except for queuing systems. \n",
    "- Neo4j is a 'graphdb' that stores entries as nodes and edges. It's hard to wrap your head around, but it does make some form of querying relatively straightforward that would otherwise not be the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having worked with Mongo, Neo4j and SQL, I can confidently say that SQL has a very prominent place in data stores. Lately, a number of domains have started to return to SQL databases. This is because while the data can be stored in other more flexible formats, ofte formats that mimic the data in other contexts, they are not so amenable to post-processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tables in SQL can be **indexed** or not. When they are indexed, using a 'key' it is easier to query and search for data. Keys keep tables organized but are not necessary. A 'primary key' is an index where each entry is unique."

    "SQL is structured query language, but not a specific database type. Most SQL is interoperable, but some is specific to the type of database. There are also SQL flavours that are used in APIs but restrict certain kinds of queries. For a while Facebook had FQL which allowed developers to query for data on select tables. This has been deprecated in favour of a graph database structure. Some example databases are:\n",
    "- ```Oracle```. The version in use in many industries. \n",
    "- ```MySQL```. An open source SQL implementation in use in a lot of server applications. It is the M in a 'LAMP stack', which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, which for many was the building block of dynamic webpages. It is being slowly replaced by NodeJS variants such as React, but is still a common way to build and serve dynamic content. \n",
    "- ```PostGRES```. A version that's often used in academia and some other environments. It can be a bit more tricky to set up than MySQL. \n",
    "- ```SQLite```. The only one of these flavours that isn't designed to be interacted with via a server. SQLite databases exist all over your computer, particularly on a mac. This is because you can just read and write to a SQLite database as if it were a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use SQLite through a number of modules. Two popular ones in python are ```sqlalchemy``` and ```sqlite3```. The former is a little more 'pythonic' in that you can interface with the database through objects and methods. SQLite3 is a little more of a wrapper around direct SQL commands. We will use SQLite3 because it is less abstract as well as allowing you to see SQL commands directly. Below we will see how to open and view details about a database. \n",
